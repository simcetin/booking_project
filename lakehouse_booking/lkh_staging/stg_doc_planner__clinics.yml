      This model extracts and standardizes clinic-related data. A clinic represents a healthcare facility where one or more doctors provide services.
      Clinics may have multiple branches in different locations and can be associated with individual doctors or groups of practitioners.

    columns:
      - name: clinic_id
        description: Unique identifier for the clinic.

        description: The name of the clinic or clinic branch.
      - name: clinic_address

      - name: is_independent
        description: >
          Indicates whether the clinic is independently operated (e.g., by a single doctor or small group) or part of a larger clinic network.
          `true` means the clinic is independent; `false` means it is part of a larger organization.

      This model extracts and documents all calendars used for scheduling visits.
      A calendar represents a virtual mapping of a doctor's availability at a specific location or for a specific clinic service.
      Calendars can be associated with individual doctors or clinic branches, and may refer to a physical location or a type of service
      (e.g., blood testing, x-rays) without a specific doctor assigned.

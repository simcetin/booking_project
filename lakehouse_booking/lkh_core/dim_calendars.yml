      A dimension table representing all active and historical calendars in the system.
      Each calendar maps to a doctor’s availability at a location (clinic) or to a service type 
      (e.g., lab test, x-ray). It combines metadata such as clinic, doctor, service, and status. 
      Removed calendars are handled with a default long-time value for completeness in time-based analyses.

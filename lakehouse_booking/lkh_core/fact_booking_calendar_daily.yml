    description: >
      This fact table provides a daily overview of each calendar along with their related bookings, 
      for the full time range during which the calendar was active. 
      
      It combines data from `dim_dates`, `dim_calendars`, and `dim_bookings` to support detailed 
      time-based analyses such as patient engagement, doctor engagement, calendar usage.
      
      Each calendar is represented for every date from the month it was created, until the month calendar was removed 
      (or a far-future placeholder date, if still active). 
      Bookings are joined to this date-calendar matrix
      to show actual appointment activity on each day, but the calendar will still appear in the dataset even 
      for days when no bookings occurred.

      The table includes only dates up to the current month, so future periods are excluded.

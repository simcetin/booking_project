  - name: fact_booking_events
    description: >
      This fact table consolidates all booking events from both internal and external systems 
      to provide a unified view of changes made to bookings over time. 
      
      Events may include status changes (e.g., confirmed, cancelled).
      The data comes from `stg_docplanner__patient_bookings_events` and 
      `stg_docplanner_external__booking_events`, merged into a single stream.

      The table is incrementally built using the `_dbt_insert_at` timestamp field to ensure efficient updates
      and late-arrived data.
      It's designed to support detailed event-level analysis, auditing, and tracking user behavior 
      across booking platforms and ownership types.

      This fact table tracks monthly patient engagement based on their booking behavior.

      A patient is considered *engaged in a given month if:
      - They had a confirmed booking in the previous month,
      - They made at least 2 bookings in the current month,
      - And at least one of those bookings was made via the mobile app.

      The model also identifies rebooking behavior (i.e., whether the patient booked again within 30 days).

      - name: year_month
        description: The year and month of booking activity.
      - name: patient_id

      This fact table measures monthly doctor engagement based on booking activity during full calendar weeks.

      A doctor is considered engaged in a given week if they meet the following criteria:
      - At least 5 confirmed bookings made during a full calendar week,
      - And at least 1 of those bookings was made via the mobile app.

      A doctor is considered engaged in a given month if they meet these weekly engagement criteria for each full week in that month.

      This model tracks:
      - The number of engaged weeks per doctor and month,
      - Whether the doctor was engaged for the entire month,
      - The first month of engagement,
      - Whether a given month is their first engaged month.

      Useful for understanding platform adoption, doctor activity levels, and supporting performance incentive programs.

        description: The year and month associated with the doctor’s activity (truncated to month).
      - name: doctor_id
